.\" sport - Slackware Port
.TH "sport" "8" ""  "Klaatu" ""
.SH "NAME"
sport \- Search, research, and install from your collection of SlackBuilds
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsport\fP [command] [package]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP 
\fBsport\fP, or "Slackware Port", is a BSD Port style tool that helps
you search through your collection of SlackBuilds, read relevant files
about each SlackBuild, and execute the build and install processes.
.PP
.SH USE CASE AND WORKFLOW
The intended use of \fBsport\fP is the same as [my use of] BSD Port, although the
exact commands are unique since the BSD Port system weilds Makefiles
to execute its commands and SlackBuilds are shell scripts. 
.PP
The workflow can be similar: as root, change directory into your
SlackBuild tree, search for the package you wish to install, and then
build and install.
.PP
Strictly speaking, you do not have to change directory into your
SlackBuilds tree, although if you're used to BSD Ports then you'll
likely do that habitually. You may find it more convenient to cd into the
SlackBuild tree, because if you do not then you must preface package
names with the SlackBuild category where the installers are kept; for
instance, system/qemu (if you are not in the SlackBuild tree) instead
of just qemu (if you are in the system directory in your SlackBuild tree).
.SH INSTALLATION
To install sport, use the included SlackBuild file, or just copy sport
to some directory in your path. The recommended location is /usr/sbin
.PP
Copy the man page to /usr/man/man8. If you are reading this, you may
have already done that.
.PP
You also must set the location of your SlackBuild tree by manually
editing the sport script, and the source of that tree so that you can
stay in sync with your source. You can obtain every script available on
SlackBuilds.org tree using rsync(1). You might place your SlackBuild
tree in /usr/slackbuilds to mimic the common BSD Ports location of
/usr/ports or you may already have a tree in /var/lib/sbopkg/SBo/??.?
if you are an sbopkg user.
.PP
Now you are ready to use sport.
.SH COMMANDS 
.PP

.TP
.B search, --search, s, -s
Performs a fuzzy search for some package. For example\&:
.IP
sport search w3m\&
.IP
Search is always fuzzy and never needs a category or wildcard. It
returns the location within your tree of all matches, plus a brief
description.
.PP
.TP 
.B cat, --cat, c, -c
Displays the README and \&.info files of some package. You want to
do this before building, since the README provides optional dependency
information and build instructions, and the .info file provides
required dependencies.
.IP
Obviously if the package you want to install has dependencies, you
should resolve those dependencies before continuing. Unlike the BSD
Ports systems, \fBsport\fP does NOT resolve dependencies for you.
.IP
The cat command will untar the SlackBuild directory if needed.
.IP
If you are in your SlackBuild tree, you can just provide the path to
the package with a dot-slash:
.IP
sport cat ./w3m
.IP
Otherwise, you must provide the path to the package from your
SBOPATH. For instance:
.IP
sport cat network/w3m
.PP
.TP 
.B build, --build, b, -b
Downloads (if needed) and executes the SlackBuild for some package. It
does not install the resulting package, leaving it instead in whatever
directory the SlackBuild places it (default from SlackBuilds.org is
/tmp). Use installpkg to install the package at your leisure.
.IP
As with \fBcat\fP, if you are in your SlackBuild tree, you can just
provide the path to the package with a dot-slash:
.IP
sport build ./w3m
.IP
Otherwise, you must provide the path to the package from your
SBOPATH. For instance:
.IP
sport build network/w3m
.PP
.TP
.B install, --install, i, -i
Downloads (if needed) and executes the SlackBuild for some package,
and then calls installpkg to install it to your system.
.IP
As with \fBcat\fP and \fBbuild\fP commands, you can provide the path
from your current location if you are in your SlackBuilds tree;
otherwise, provide the path from SBOPATH.
.PP
.TP 
.B check, --check, k, -k
Checks /var/log/packages to see if a package is installed. Very fuzzy
search; not meant to replace pkgtool, just a convenience.
.PP
.TP
.B clean, --clean, l, -l
Removes the directory containing the source code and SlackBuild. It of
course leaves any compressed copy of your SlackBuild directory (the
SlackBuild.org structure). If you are not using the SlackBuild.org
tree, then you should either keep your originals as compressed
archives or do you should probably not use the \fBclean\fP command.
.PP
.TP
.B rsync, --rsync, r, -r
Synchronizes your local tree with your source tree, as defined in the
sport script itself. By default sport is set to mimic sbopkg. If you
are not using sbopkg then you may change this manually.
.IP
sport rsync
.IP
Would pull in any updates for your tree.
