This programme is not yet complete.

* DONE parse flags with shift

* DONE parse multiple install arguments, ie sport i foo bar baz

* NOT-TODO make it possible to bump version number of install target
 - ie, vlock version 0.8 is in slackbuilds. provide an option that
   replaces '0.8' with '0.9'
 - NO this is a stupid idea. Let the user open up emacs and change it
   him or herself. This is not sport's job and it is
   slack-deficient. also, it's too hard to implement.
 
* TODO bug fix the queue file thing. not working 100%

* TODO bug fix multiple install downloads in foo.info file
 - ie, Handbrake's 52 codec downloads
